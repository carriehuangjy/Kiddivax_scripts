## Overview

In this study, we aim to process and reformat raw data related to a study examining the protective efficacy against pandemic influenza of seasonal influenza vaccination in children in Hong Kong. 

## Scripts

- `dataframe.r` is used to reformat raw data.

- `Figure_2.r` shows the timeline of subject recruitment and follow-up in 2009–2010.

- `Table_1.r` shows the baseline characteristics of children who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or placebo and their household contacts.

- `Table_2.r` indicates the immunogenicity of the 2009–2010 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine against seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.

- `Table_3.r` presents incidence rates per person-year of infection of laboratory-confirmed influenza by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology, acute respiratory illness, and febrile acute respiratory illness among study subjects who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or placebo.

- `Table_S1.r` shows the adverse reactions reported by children who received TIV or placebo.

- `Table_S2.r` shows the signs, symptoms, and syndromes associated with influenza A and B infections confirmed by RT-PCR in study subjects.

- `Table_S3.r` shows the comparisons of estimates of the cumulative incidence of infection among participants during the winter, summer, and overall study periods.

- `Table_S4.r` shows the cumulative incidence of infection of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (pH1N1) among children who received TIV or placebo, stratified by post-vaccination antibody titer against pH1N1.
