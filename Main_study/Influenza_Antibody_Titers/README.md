## Overview

In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HAI) titers and protection against influenza virus infection in children. We found that higher HAI titers were significantly associated with greater protection against confirmed influenza virus infection, estimating that an HAI titer of 1:110 provided a 50% reduction in risk and an HAI titer of 1:330 provided an 80% reduction in risk.

## Scripts

In the code folder we provide the R files as follows:
  
- `Figure_1.r` generates timeline of the study, influenza activity in the community was based on a proxy measure and postvaccination, midstudy, and poststudy HAI titers against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B(Victoria lineage) virus in children.
  
- `Figure_2.r` generates the estimated protection against infection among study participants, based on HAI titers at 1 to 9 months following receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).
  
- `source_1.r` contains source code for a specific functionality of calculating a rescale factor obtained from the proxy for influenza A and B and performs various data wrangling operations and statistical calculations to estimate the association between antibody titers and protection against confirmed influenza virus infection in children.
  
- `source_2.r` reads data files, performs data cleaning and processing, and fits several Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models to the data. The models estimate the association between antibody titers and protection against influenza virus infection, and the effect of vaccination on antibody titers and protection. In additions, the script also calculates sample sizes for each group in the study.
  
- `source_3.r` generates a statistical model that evaluates the correlation between HAI titer and subsequent protection against confirmed influenza virus infection in children. It reads in data and uses Cox model to take into account the background risk of infection, waning HAI antibodies, and beta*titer(t0). It also creates a smoothed proxy for background risk and merges PCR type and date. Finally, the code creates a dataframe for the best waning parameter value and uses Coxph to find the correlation between post-vaccination and proxy.
  
- `source_4.r` predicts the post-vaccination titers of influenza B virus for each participant in a study.
  
- `source_5.r` performs data analysis on serology data for different interventions (TIV and placebo) and different viruses (pH1 and B.Brisbane).
  
- `source_6.r` investigates the impact of influenza vaccines on serology titers over time, specifically comparing the effectiveness of TIV and placebo interventions for different influenza strains.

- `Appendix_Figure_1.r` shows post-vaccination, mid-study and post-study HAI titers against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B (Victoria-lineage) virus. 
  
- `Appendix_Table_1.r` indicates the baseline characteristics of 773 children who were randomized to receive TIV or placebo and for whom post-vaccination HAI antibody titers were available. 
  
- `Appendix_Table_2.r` shows the estimated waning rate of HAI titers among children who were randomized to receive TIV or placebo.
