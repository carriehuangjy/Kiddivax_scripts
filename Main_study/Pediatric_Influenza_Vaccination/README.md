## Overview

We aim to process and reformat raw data related to a study examining the effect of age and recent influenza vaccination history on the immunogenicity and efficacy of the 2009-10 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination in children. 

## Scripts

- `dataframe.r` reformats the raw data for the study.

- `Figure_1.r` shows individual antibody titers before and one month after receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in 2009–2010 among 6–8 y (Y, represented by blue circles) and 9–17 y children (O, represented by grey circles) with regard to their vaccination history for the 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 seasons.

- `Table_2.r` indicates characteristics of 479 subjects randomized to receive trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in 2009–10 with regard to their vaccination history in 2007–08 and 2008–09.

- `Table_3.r` presents factors affecting risk of RT-PCR confirmed influenza B infection and vaccine efficacy (VE) of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in 2009–10.

- `Figure_S2.r` shows the individual antibody titers before and one month after receipt of placebo in 2009–2010 among 6–8 y (Y, represented by blue circles) and 9–17 y children (O, represented by grey circles) with regard to their vaccination history for the 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 seasons.

- `Table_S1.r` shows comparison of antibody titers before and 1 month after receipt of 2009–10 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in children 6–8 years of age with regard to their vaccination history.

- `Table_S2.r` presents comparison of antibody titers before and 1 month after receipt of 2009–10 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in children 9–17 years of age with regard to their vaccination history.

- `Table_S3.r` shows the comparison of antibody titers before and 1 month after receipt of placebo in children 6–8 years of age with regard to their vaccination history.

- `Table_S4.r` shows the comparison of antibody titers before and 1 month after receipt of placebo in children 9–17 years of age with regard to their vaccination history.
