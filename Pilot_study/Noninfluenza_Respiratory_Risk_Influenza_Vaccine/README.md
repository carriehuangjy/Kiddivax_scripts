## Overview

The KiddivaxPilot_CID_respiratory_scripts repository contains the scripts used for analyzing and processing data specifically related to the respiratory outcomes in the Kiddivax Pilot study of the pediatric vaccine trial research project. These scripts perform various tasks such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, and generating tables and figures specifically focused on respiratory data.

## Scripts

- `dataframe.r` reformats the raw data of the study.

- `Figure_1.r` illustrates the timing of influenza and other respiratory virus detections.

- `Table_1.r` shows the characteristics of participants and duration of follow-up.

- `Table_2.r` indicates the incidence rates of acute upper respiratory tract infection among 115 participants aged 6–15 years who received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or placebo.

- `Table_3.r` shows incidence rates of respiratory virus detection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and multiplex assay.


## Usage

To use this dataset and analysis code, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and RStudio or any other R environment if you haven't already.
3. Open the R script in the `code` directory using RStudio or your preferred R environment.
4. Run the script to reproduce the data used in the study and perform further analysis as desired.

Please note that you may need to adjust file paths or make other modifications to the code to suit your specific environment or requirements.
