The repository has the following file structure:

- `Figure_1to3.r` reproduces information for Figure 1-3.
  
- `MCMC_function.r` produces the MCMC function used in the study.
  
- `Table_1.r` shows the risk of influenza virus infection by individual characteristics in 425 adults and children.
  
- `Table_2.r` shows the subtype-specific estimates of community probabilities of infection and SAPs for children and adults.
  
- `eTable_2.r` reproduces information for eTable 2.
  
- `eTable_3.r` reproduces information for eTable 3.
  
- `eTable_4.r` reproduces information for eTable 4.
  
- `eTable_5.r` reproduces information for eTable 5.
