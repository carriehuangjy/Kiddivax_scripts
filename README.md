# Kiddivax Scripts

This repository contains scripts related to the titer protection analysis for the KiddivaxMain pediatric vaccine trial.

## Overview

`Influenza_Antibody_Titers` contains the source code for the research paper titled "Estimation of the association between antibody titers and protection against confirmed influenza virus infection in children" by Ng et al published in the Journal of Infectious Disease in 2013.

In this study, we aime to determine the relationship between hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers and protection against influenza virus infection in children. We found that higher HI titers were significantly associated with greater protection against confirmed influenza virus infection, estimating that an HI titer of 1:110 provided a 50% reduction in risk and an HI titer of 1:330 provided an 80% reduction in risk.

`Humoral_Antibody_Response` contains an R script for processing and reformatting raw data related to the humoral antibody response after receipt of inactivated seasonal influenza vaccinations one year apart in children. The study is based on the paper by Ng S, et al. (PIDJ, 2012).

In a randomized controlled trial, we administered seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or placebo to subjects 6â€“15 years of age in two consecutive years. Receipt of TIV in year 2 induced seroprotection in most subjects. Among 39 children who received TIV in the second year, receipt of TIV in the first year was associated with lower antibody titer rises in the second year to seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) strains for which the vaccine strains remained unchanged. Antibody response to a different influenza B strain in the second year was unaffected by receipt of TIV in the first year.

`Pediatric_Influenza_Vaccination` contains an R script for processing and reformatting raw data related to the effect of age and recent influenza vaccination history on the immunogenicity and efficacy of 2009-10 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination in children. The study is based on the paper by Ng S, et al. (PLoS ONE 2013).

We aim to process and reformat raw data related to a study examining the effect of age and recent influenza vaccination history on the immunogenicity and efficacy of the 2009-10 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination in children.

`Pandemic_Influenza_Protection_HK_Children` contains an R script for processing and reformatting raw data related to the protective efficacy against pandemic influenza of seasonal influenza vaccination in children in Hong Kong. The study is based on the paper by Cowling BJ, et al. (CID, 2012).

In this study, we aim to process and reformat raw data related to a study examining the protective efficacy against pandemic influenza of seasonal influenza vaccination in children in Hong Kong.

`Noninfluenza_Respiratory_Risk_Influenza_Vaccine` contains the scripts related to the respiratory analysis in the Kiddivax Pilot study of the pediatric vaccine trial research project. These scripts are specific to the analysis and processing of data related to respiratory outcomes in the context of the CID (Community-Associated Infections and Disease) module of the study.

Oxford academic link: https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098

The KiddivaxPilot_CID_respiratory_scripts repository contains the scripts used for analyzing and processing data specifically related to the respiratory outcomes in the Kiddivax Pilot study of the pediatric vaccine trial research project. These scripts perform various tasks such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, and generating tables and figures specifically focused on respiratory data.

`Influenza_Vaccine_Efficacy_HK_2009` contains the scripts used in the Kiddivax Pilot study of the pediatric vaccine trial research project. These scripts are designed for various tasks related to the study, including data analysis, visualization, and processing.
